Paris. The city of lights, romance, and apparently, a surprising amount of walking.  

Getting there was the first surprise. We landed at Paris Beauvais, which—spoiler alert—is nowhere near Paris. If you ever book a flight there, just know that it’ll take you another 1.5 hours (and a bus ride) to actually get to the city. Lesson learned.  

But once we arrived, it was Paris in all its glory. First stop? The Louvre. I don’t know what I was expecting, but the Mona Lisa? Much smaller than I imagined. The crowd, however, was anything but small. Packed shoulder to shoulder, all trying to get a glimpse (or a selfie) with da Vinci’s most famous lady. Worth it? Definitely. Would I do it again? Maybe not.

Now, let’s talk food. Because if you’re in Paris and not eating pastries, you’re doing it wrong. We stopped at a random French bakery, and I don’t think I can ever eat a croissant outside of France again. Buttery, flaky, perfect. The kind of thing that makes you rethink your life choices.

Night fell, and we made our way to the Eiffel Tower for the light show. It sparkled, it glowed, it was everything we hoped for. What we didn’t hope for? Both our phone batteries dying at the same time. No photos, no GPS, just old-school navigation. Reading metro maps, following street signs, and actually using our brains. A humbling experience, but at least we remembered the station near our hotel.

The next day, we had a booked tour for the Eiffel Tower. Key word: had. A train incident threw our plans off completely, and we missed our time slot. Thankfully, we managed to squeeze onto another tour, but by the end of the day, our legs were begging for mercy. So much walking. Paris really is best explored on foot, but wow, it takes a toll.

A whirlwind weekend. Some surprises, some lessons learned, but Paris? Still magical.
