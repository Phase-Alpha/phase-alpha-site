As travel starts to become more accessible again, work sends me to the Sunshine State for…well…work.

## Travel Requirements and Initial Impressions

I have to put this out there though, travel requirements are changing rapidly. I left the U.K with a pack of tests (both PCR and rapid antigen). Two days after landing in Orlando and heading to Tampa, I don’t need a test to get back to the U.K anymore? I can’t keep up.

It is surprising how warm it is during the wintertime in Florida, 29 degrees Celsius! That is almost heatwave weather in rainy Manchester.

## Arrival and Accommodation

$120 and 2 hours is all it took to get to my humble abode (for 2 weeks). Not bad for a 2-hour taxi ride, but still, I’m glad it was a business trip. Trust me to pick the wrong hotel though. Although the room was amazing, the breakfast selection was very poor. I was able to get through the entire menu in 3 days. And there was no on-site restaurant.

## Navigating Florida

Florida is definitely not made for walking. Crossing the road is a mission (12 lanes total nearly). It takes about 10 minutes for the crossing light to turn and all of 2 seconds for the countdown to get to the other side to begin. Not to mention, turning right on red should be outlawed on any roads that have a crossing. It shouldn’t be possible to be hit by a car at a crossing!

## Unexpected Encounters

On a side note, alligators are everywhere. Just imagine casually walking to the office, turning around, and spotting an alligator less than 20 meters away from you outside your hotel. Not to mention the office alligator, who has been named Clarence. I’ll be honest, the office we have at the Florida site is so much nicer—the building, scenery, there is even a cafeteria! Everyone gets their own cubicle, makes me feel like I am in a movie or TV show.

## Weekend in Tampa

After a relatively long work week (the Florida office doesn’t get the half-day Friday), I got the weekend to myself. So first stop was the aquarium in Tampa. A 30-minute taxi ride that costs like $43, transportation costs are quite steep in Tampa. I’ll let you in on a little secret, I found Nemo!

The best thing about downtown Tampa has got to be the free tram that takes you around. I highly recommend visiting the chocolatiers that also happen to make ice cream. I got the pistachio and chocolate flavor.

## Wildlife and Local Transportation

On my second week, I managed to spot more (less threatening) wildlife—a cat. Not sure if that cat was crazy or what, I mean there were alligators around, what was it doing outside? A part of me wanted to take it home.

## Road Tripping for Leisure

Now that the business was over, it was time for a little pleasure. Since Ubers were expensive, it seemed more cost-effective to rent a car for a couple of days. I could probably save a lot of money in taxi fees this way, especially since we started the vacation in Orlando.

The plan was to spend a couple of days in Orlando, head to Columbus, Ohio, then San Francisco, finishing up in Dallas. Anti-clockwise around the United States. Road-tripping in America is only fun if you have a month to dedicate to it. Driving the long distances is really exhausting; getting to the West Coast from the East takes 3 days of nonstop driving. It is a no-brainer really, flying gives you much more time at the destinations and much less time wasted on the road.

## Orlando: Disney World and Dining

First port of call, Disney World. I have to say, it is extortion. $150 per person per day? But you have to see it at least once and make sure you stay all day until the fireworks at night. We got lucky and caught the 50th anniversary display. They definitely know how to put on a show; it takes you back to your childhood.

I’m always seeing Giordano’s Chicago deep-dish pizza on Instagram, so we decided to try it in Orlando. I know, I know, better off going to the mothership in Chicago, but I have to say, it was still pretty darn good. I want to go again just to try the original cheese deep-dish though; barbecue chicken was a bit overpowering.

## Orlando Airport Woes

Orlando International Airport is a nightmare by the way. Make sure you arrive 4 hours before your flight. Not only is there a 2-hour queue at the check-in desk, there’s another 2 hours of waiting at security. I hated this airport when I landed, and I still hate it when I’m leaving.

## Columbus, Ohio: Winter Wonderland

3 hours later and we land in Columbus, OH. The USA is quite a big country. Not only do you have different time zones, there are different seasons across the country too! There was 30 cm of snow, but I have to say, they know how to handle it. Unlike in England, a little snow and the country comes to a halt.

## Dining in Columbus

Apart from cheesecake, what makes the Cheesecake Factory so good? The portion sizes are ridiculous. Three people can share a meal ordered from this place.

Unfortunately, there isn’t much else to say about Columbus, OH. It was cold and we didn’t spend too much time outside. But nothing beats spending quality time with the family.

## Columbus Airport: Pros and Cons

The best thing about the airport at Columbus (CMH) was that it was nearly empty. You can show up for your flight about an hour before you need to be on the plane and still make it through check-in and security with time to spare. One downfall though, there don’t seem to be any international flights, or even direct flights to all of the places you might want to go. If you are going to San Francisco from CMH, be prepared for at least one transfer. It took us 7 hours to get to San Francisco from CMH.

## San Francisco: Arrival and Exploration

If you ever make your way to San Francisco, I recommend the transport system to get to your hotel, especially if you are traveling light. You can get from the airport to downtown San Francisco for less than $10 with the BART system. In Orlando, a taxi set me back $50, but I guess you pay for the convenience.

The hotel was amazing! Amex upgraded our room and gave us a complimentary night! Another perk of the gold card: [Gold Card Referral](http://amex.co.uk/refer/aHMEDH7jQg?XL=MIMNS).

## First Stop: Fisherman’s Wharf

First stop? Fisherman’s Wharf! I know you thought I was going to say, “Golden Gate Bridge.” But that was just too far to walk after the long journey. Unfortunately, we got there too late for the sea lions. But we got a great sunset view and hot chocolate at Ghirardelli Square.

## Exploring San Francisco

Of all the American cities I’ve visited, San Francisco is definitely the hilliest. We did not pick a good route back to the hotel. It was almost like a 60-degree incline all the way back.

On day 2, we decided to walk to—you guessed it—the Golden Gate Bridge. From our hotel, it was a 5-mile walk. Pretty far, so why not stop at Russian Hill along the way to watch some cars navigate a bendy road on a slope really slowly haha.

About 3 hours later, we reached our destination, with some stops along the way. If we arrived earlier, it would have been worth crossing the bridge, climbing the hill on the other side, and watching the sunset.

## Final Stop: Dallas

A couple of days and lots of food later, we headed to Dallas, which was surprisingly the cheapest and quickest flight we had taken. Gotta take Alaska Airlines if you want that direct non-stop flight. I’ve been to Dallas far too many times to count because of family, but here’s a picture of the iconic bulls for you all.
