18 months feels like such a long time to go without travel.
I had forgotten what it feels like to be on a plane during take off and landing, a lot more nerve wrecking than I remember… but maybe I was just used to it from flying twice a year or so regularly for the last 10 years.

Some friendly advice, with the current climate, and ridiculous amount of paperwork, keep it simple. We opted for multi-city, definitely a lot more complicated than I ever would have imagined.
Spain doesn’t require a COVID test if you have been fully vaccinated (or didn’t at the time I wrote this), but Portugal does, so because we had a 2 hour layover, we had to have a test, even though our final destination didn’t require it.

Don’t get me started on passenger locator forms. You have to fill them out for every place, even when you’re just transferring at the airport…

12 hours later and we were at our hotel in Barcelona. The city is so beautiful that it took all of 10 minutes to forget about all of the hurdles we had to jump through.

I’ve been meaning to go to Barcelona, not sure why it took 10 years to get around to it.
Let’s get to it though, Gaudi’s master piece, Le Sagrada Familia, this marvel will move you in some way or other, even if you aren’t artistically inclined.
I would have to say this is one of the main reasons I’ve wanted to visit (and the food). I well up thinking about how this piece of art is still under construction, to this day. Gaudi managed to bring together so many artisans, from beyond the grave, creating a project that grows larger than life as the years go by.
If you haven’t been to see it, I can’t urge you enough to buy a ticket right now and just go.

Now, about some of the food.
There are amazing brunch places; Alsur Cafe, and Cremat11, were a couple of the cafes we tried. It is a tourist hot spot, so they are quite busy.
Try the banana pancakes, or the toasted egg and salmon bagel, from Alsur.

If you are looking for a typical European breakfast (and to save a lot more cash), try a coffee and a Brioche or croissant from La Masala Cafe.
I went with the home brewed Masala Chai, which was pleasantly unsweetened!

For lunch on the move (and you will walk a lot, so bring comfortable shoes), I highly recommend the porcini pizza from, Les Dues Sicilies.

Next stop on this journey, Lisbon. Once again, it was compulsory to take a COVID test before traveling to Portugal, this has me thinking that we picked the wrong route… The test in Barcelona was seriously invasive, everyone was coming out of the centre with tears running down their eyes, felt like I was violated!

Lisbon was far sunnier and hotter than Barcelona. It was also far easier to get to the hotel from the airport, only set us back €3.

Because of the heat, we only managed to hit 20,000 steps a day in Lisbon, that extra 6 degrees of heat really takes a toll on you.
Guess what?? We rode the no. 28 tram line, the line which is essentially overrun with tourists, thus making it useless for locals… definitely a beautiful ride though, makes we wonder if it might feel like this on a San Francisco tram as well.

If you decide to get the Lisboa Card (great if you’re interested in museums and galleries). You have to stop by MAAT, it’s the museum of Art and Architecture, the building itself is a must see, even if you don’t go inside. The bridge takes you onto the roof of the building!!

Now a little bit about food, I know that pastel de Nata is a must,  but hear me out, chocolate cake at Landeau Chocolate cannot be missed! Make sure to try it!
I seriously wanted to buy the 3kg cake they were selling, had to settle for a slice though.

Had to take one more COVID test before heading back. Seriously, this test made the one in Barcelona feel like a walk in the park. I actually cried and sneezed at the same time, and I’m pretty sure I was smelling blood for a good few minutes after that test. On the plus side, it was free!
It feels like the tests in the UK are extortionate in comparison to Spain and Portugal. We should not be paying £40 for a travel antigen test.
