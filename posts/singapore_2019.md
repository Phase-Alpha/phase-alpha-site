Our recent trip to Singapore was an exhilarating blend of vibrant city life, lush greenery, and unforgettable experiences. Here’s a detailed account of our whirlwind adventure in this incredible city-state.

## Arrival and First Impressions

Traveling from the U.K. to Singapore took a grueling 19 hours! If you're planning a trip, I highly recommend a layover in the Middle East for a couple of days. We only had a 2-hour break in Abu Dhabi, and it was definitely not enough. 

Despite the long journey, we dove straight into exploring. A walk around the area introduced us to the lively atmosphere at Hong Lim Park, where live music filled the air. Fitness seems to be a big deal here, as we saw a running group working out at 9 PM. Even at night, it’s quite warm, which took some getting used to.

## Greenery and Iconic Sights

One of the first things that struck me about Singapore was the abundance of greenery integrated into the urban landscape. It’s like a seamless blend of forest and city, which is quite cool to see.

We took a train to the Marina from our hotel. Singapore is relatively small, making it easy to get around. The cleanliness of the city and its public transport is remarkable. Our first stop was the Maritime Museum, where we learned about Singapore's historical and ongoing significance as a trade hub.

Next, we saw the iconic Marina Bay Sands building. It looks even more impressive in real life. The highlight of the day was Gardens by the Bay, a stunning blend of nature and technology. There's so much to see here, and staying until night to catch the light show at the Supertree Grove is a must. We wrapped up our day with a meal at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

## Culinary Delights and Night Safari

For lunch, we headed to Clarke Quay and had the best seafood I’ve ever eaten. The rest of the day was spent resting in preparation for the night safari.

We grabbed some drinks at the Traders Market and tried an actual ice cream sandwich – ice cream between sliced bread. It sounds odd but tastes fantastic. The night safari was a unique and entertaining experience. The highlight was a show featuring ferrets that were trained to recycle, blending entertainment with an important environmental lesson.

## Botanical Bliss

We spent the day exploring the Botanical Gardens. Singapore’s commitment to greenery is evident everywhere, making it a refreshing and beautiful place to visit.

## City Exploration and Departure

Our last day in Singapore was spent exploring the city area and trying tornado potatoes. Be cautious when asking for spicy food in Singapore – they take their spice seriously! 

As our flight was in the evening, we packed our bags early and headed to the airport to spend some time at the Jewel. Changi Airport is hands down the best airport I’ve ever been to. The Jewel, with its stunning waterfall at the center, is a marvel.

Our trip to Singapore was short but packed with incredible experiences. From the stunning Gardens by the Bay to the unique night safari and the impeccable Changi Airport, Singapore is a destination I would definitely return to. If you’re planning a visit, prepare for warm weather, delicious food, and a city that beautifully combines urban life with lush greenery.
