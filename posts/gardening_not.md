For analogies, I imagine people don’t usually use weeds as a good example. They should though, honestly!
Weeds persevere. Always growing towards that sunlight, nothing gets in their way, through barely fertile earth, through concrete, they grow.
Once they’ve set their roots and grown sufficiently they’ll stay put, stubbornly refusing to go away even growing spikes to stop you pulling them out.

The weeds in our garden were growing out of control.

Spending an entire week pulling them out did not solve them problem.

The initial idea was to pack as much as possible into the garden.


Unfortunately the budget did not allow for a waterfall and olive trees…
We thought it was better to keep it simple for a first home garden.

After contacting a few landscapers, we managed to get a reasonably priced quote. I’m not sure how the managed to get this equipment into the garden because we only have a small entrance, I came home to this and it was quite a shock how much they could get done so quickly.

I bet you didn’t think that this post was about a garden renovation!
