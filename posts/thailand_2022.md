Our recent trip to Thailand was nothing short of an adventure. With a packed itinerary and diverse experiences, we explored everything from the bustling streets of Bangkok to the tranquil islands of Koh Samui, and finally, the serene beauty of Chiang Mai. Here’s a rundown of our journey.

## Bangkok: A City of Contrasts

### Chatuchak Weekend Market and Park

Our first stop in Bangkok was the famous Chatuchak Weekend Market. This sprawling market was an explosion of colors, smells, and sounds. We indulged in coconut ice cream and mango sticky rice, which were both delightful. As we navigated through the market, we experienced our first encounter with Thailand's short and sudden torrential rains. Everyone scrambled for cover, creating quite the spectacle.

After the market, we strolled through Chatuchak Park, soaking in the green spaces and watching locals enjoy their day. We headed back to our hotel located in the MBK Center. Hotels within malls are a common feature in Bangkok, and the MBK Center itself is a massive complex with around 3,000 stores. However, most stores closed early (maybe it’s another Covid related rule), so we resorted to instant noodles at the hotel for dinner.

### Temples and Chinatown Delights

On our second day, we treated ourselves to castella, a delicious sponge cake, before embarking on a tour of Bangkok’s renowned temples. The intricate architecture and serene atmosphere were captivating. We ended the day in Chinatown, where we savored amazing dim sum for dinner.

### Parks and Thrills

Lumphini Park was our destination on the third day. We were amazed by the monitor lizards roaming freely. Later, we ventured to the tower in Silom, where we braved the glass floor, peering down at the city below – an experience both thrilling and terrifying.

### Cultural Wonders and Culinary Treats

Day four was dedicated to more cultural exploration. We visited the majestic Reclining Buddha statue and watched the sunset over Wat Arun, which was breathtaking. For dinner, we tried the Michelin-starred street food by the famous “goggles grandma.” Despite the long wait, the food was worth it. We ended the day with an hour-long, incredibly affordable massage. Let me tell you, Thai women are strong!

## Koh Samui: Island Paradise

### Arrival and First Impressions

We jetted off to Koh Samui on the fifth day. The island’s airport felt like a mini-resort, setting the perfect tone for our stay. However, our hotel’s location was a bit eerie at night, with the constant barking of dogs.

### Road Trip and Elephant Encounter

On our second day in Samui, we took a road trip around the island. The highlight was feeding and bathing elephants, an unforgettable experience that brought us closer to these magnificent creatures.

### Island Hopping Adventure

We embarked on an island-hopping and snorkeling tour on the third day. The ocean waves were quite rough, and my swimming skills proved insufficient. I had to be rescued by an Australian, which was a bit embarrassing but made for a good story.

### Go-Karting and Culinary Delights

Our fourth day was filled with fun as we went go-karting. Later, we enjoyed the best bao buns I’ve ever tasted. Koh Samui continued to surprise us with its hidden gems.

## Chiang Mai: Northern Serenity

### Arrival and Rainy Welcome

We flew to Chiang Mai on the fifth day. The northern city greeted us with its beautiful landscapes, but the rain seemed incessant.

### Festivals and Farewell

On our second day in Chiang Mai, we flew back to Bangkok for one last adventure. We visited a halal food festival and a fruit festival right outside the Diamond Mall. Despite being hit by another torrential downpour, it was a fun-filled day and a perfect end to our trip.

Thailand offered a mix of urban excitement, island relaxation, and cultural richness. Each destination had its unique charm, and we left with memories to cherish forever. If you’re considering a trip to Thailand, I highly recommend immersing yourself in its diverse experiences – you won’t be disappointed.  

P.S. If you are in Thailand (Bangkok), try and get ahold of a Dark Dino, its just amazing!
