A bit of a different trip this time. I’ve been working in software and automation development for a while, but I finally decided to make the full transition from mechanical engineering-based software development to a broader software engineering career.  
Luckily, I got accepted onto a software engineering course backed by Imperial College London. The catch? I found out *after* booking this trip.  

So, for the first time ever, this wasn’t just a holiday—it was a holiday with classes.

## Getting There  

Flew with Swiss Air and had a layover in Zurich. Fun fact: Zurich Airport has a flight viewing deck with binoculars, so you can watch planes take off and land. A nice touch while waiting for the next flight.  

Landed in Dubai at 2 AM. I don’t know what it is about flights to and from the Middle East, but they always seem to happen at the most inconvenient hours.

## First Impressions  

After catching up on some much-needed sleep, we spent the first evening at **Global Village**.  
It’s a huge outdoor festival where each country or continent has its own area with food, shopping, and entertainment. Standouts?  
- The **best** mango sticky rice I’ve ever had outside of Thailand.  
- The **Bosnian kebab stall**—super popular and for good reason.

## Balancing Travel and Study  

The next day, my software engineering course officially started. The requirement? Stay online for a daily lecture for the first two weeks, then weekly sessions for six months, plus assignments and exams. Finding a café with good WiFi in the Middle East is surprisingly easy, so that helped.

Later, we explored **Dubai Mall**. The mall itself was nice, and they even have a **light show**, similar to the one in Singapore.  

**Pro tip:** If you take the metro there, leave early. The metro isn’t 24/7, and if you miss it, taxis *will* take advantage of you.  

For dinner, we tried **P.F. Chang’s**. Not exactly local cuisine, but the **Dynamite Shrimp**? Worth it.

## Beach, Burgers & The Marina  

Started the next day at **Marina Beach**, but first, a quick **1:1 call with a course tutor** at a nearby café to clear up some learning hour requirements. Breakfast? **Nutella muffins and coffee.**  

Then, **the beach.**  

Unfortunately, my shoes were *not* the right choice. Sand and bad footwear don’t mix.  

For lunch, we tried **Salt**—decent burgers, but a bit pricey. Walked along the **marina** after. Honestly, I could happily live on a marina. They always look amazing—at least in the Middle East.

## Abu Dhabi: Slower, Quieter, Different  

We rented a car and drove to **Abu Dhabi** for a few days. Once outside Dubai, the roads were smooth, and the drive was actually relaxing.  

Abu Dhabi has a much **quieter, more relaxed** vibe. The malls here, though? *Confusing.*  

---

## Desert Safari & Connectivity Fail  

Next day, we had a **desert safari** booked. Let me tell you, getting online for a lecture in the *middle of the desert*? Not happening. I don’t know what I was thinking.  

The safari itself?  
- **Camel riding** ✔️  
- **Dune bashing** ✔️ (Could have been longer, though.)  

Back in Abu Dhabi, we took a scenic walk down **The Corniche**—perfect for jogging or cycling.

## The Grand Mosque & The Sweetest Surprise  

We visited **Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque**, and it did *not* disappoint. An architectural masterpiece.  

Then, it was time for another lecture, so we stopped by **Parker’s**, a café we’d been meaning to try. Their **Matilda cake** (inspired by *that* scene in *Matilda*) was ridiculously good—chocolate poured all over it.  

Later that night, we checked out **Emirates Palace**. Finding parking? A challenge. But inside, we were surprised to find the **largest Christmas tree** we’d ever seen.

## The Last Few Stops  

On our last day in Abu Dhabi, we made a quick stop at **Yas Island** before driving back to Dubai.  

Apparently, buying **Apple products** in the Middle East is cheaper than in the UK (though still not as cheap as in the US). We checked out some phones but didn’t end up buying anything.  

Back in Dubai, we returned the rental car—probably should have done that *before* exploring the **Gold Souks** area. The traffic was intense, but at least the metro was nearby.  

Dinner was at **Dubai Creek**, a beautiful riverside spot designed to look like an old town. We ordered seafood, but the portions? *Huge.* If you ever go, **order less than you think you need.**

## The Journey Home (via Switzerland)  

On the way back, we had a layover in **Switzerland**, which was a *shock* to the system temperature-wise. We didn’t even have coats.  

We stayed indoors as much as possible but still managed to:  
- Visit a **museum**  
- Grab a **hot chocolate**  
- Try **fondue** (which, fun fact, is supposedly lactose-intolerant-friendly—though that’s not an issue for us)

## Final Thoughts  

This trip was a mix of **new experiences, studying, and navigating two very different cities.**  

Would I juggle coursework and travel again? Maybe. But next time, I’ll rethink my internet connection plans before heading into the desert.
