### Discovering Bali and Qatar: A Journey Through Island Bliss and Middle Eastern Charm

If you’ve never been to Indonesia or the Middle East, you’re definitely missing out. My travel story took a few unexpected turns, starting with a honeymoon that was meant to include Bali, only to get postponed. But three months later, we were ready to take on Bali with an exciting twist: a stopover in Qatar on the way back. Here’s how our journey unfolded.

## The Journey Begins: Qatar Airways and Hamad International Airport

Our adventure kicked off with a long journey on Qatar Airways (a fantastic airline if you ask me!). With a short layover at Doha’s Hamad International Airport, we stretched our legs, took in the famous giant teddy bear sculpture, and settled back for the rest of the flight to Bali.

Arriving late into Bali meant a lengthy transfer to our hotel in Ubud, with a few extra stops along the way. By the time we arrived, the exhaustion quickly faded as we stepped into a stunningly peaceful hotel nestled in the jungle.

## Bali Unveiled: Ubud’s Jungle Vibes and Cultural Adventures

After settling in, we took a brief nighttime stroll to find some dinner. Bali’s culinary scene did not disappoint, as we were able to feast on lobster that didn’t break the bank! That first night brought a torrential downpour, the sound of rain adding an almost meditative ambiance to the surrounding jungle.

The next morning, the rain had subsided, and we began our day with breakfast before heading out to explore Ubud. Our hotel was a short walk from the famous Monkey Sanctuary—a surreal experience in itself. They say not to carry food with you around the monkeys, and they mean it; these little guys are bold and quick!

Our next stop was the mesmerising rice terraces, an Instagram-worthy spot that felt almost otherworldly. While there, we tried Bali’s famous civet cat coffee, a treat often surrounded by skepticism due to imitations. Thankfully, we eventually found the real deal and even got to see the civet cats responsible for this unique coffee.

## Island Hopping: Discovering Nusa Lembongan

From Ubud, we set out for an island adventure, taking a speedboat to Nusa Lembongan. The ride felt surprisingly similar to a plane hitting turbulence, which was an experience all its own. Upon arrival, we found Nusa Lembongan to be incredibly tranquil, a stark contrast to the busier areas of Bali.

Here, transportation is key, and it’s best if you’re comfortable with a scooter. After my less-than-stellar attempt at riding tandem, we hopped on the back of a local’s bike for a quick lift, eventually renting a small cart to explore the island.

The island has its quirks; for instance, late-night strolls aren’t advised unless you’re okay with a few unexpected encounters with local dogs. But overall, the island is a serene paradise, offering a peaceful escape from the mainland.

## Back to Bali: Seminyak’s Luxury and Unforgettable Sunsets

After our island adventure, we returned to Bali and headed to Seminyak, where we were greeted by pure luxury. Our hotel even provided a golf cart to take us to our private villa! Breakfast was served in the pool, which, oddly enough, wasn’t as messy as one might expect.

One of the highlights was a personal massage—a memorable experience, though I quickly learned that my feet are a little too sensitive for a deep massage. Between spa treatments and exploring local shops, we even scored a free villa stay from a marketing promotion we stumbled into.


Evenings in Seminyak were magical, especially with sunsets on the beach that felt straight out of a postcard.

## Exploring Qatar: Souq Waqif, The Pearl, and a Gondola Ride in a Mall

Our Bali adventure wrapped up with a stopover in Qatar, where we stayed near Souq Waqif. Qatar was a fascinating mix of old and new, and the Souq Waqif was a blend of traditional markets and vibrant street life. However, crossing the streets here was a bit challenging, as many pedestrian lights seemed out of commission.  

The Islamic museum is a must see if you have the time, not only is the archictecture spectacular, the exhibits are also amazing and quite informative. Similarly, if you have time, the national museum is also a marvel.

Among the unforgettable treats was the best kanafeh I’d ever tasted, nestled in a shop we almost missed despite circling the area multiple times. The Villaggio Mall was another highlight, complete with an indoor gondola ride that felt like a touch of Venice in the desert.

Finally, we visited The Pearl, a luxurious area filled with expat communities, where pedestrian crossings actually worked, and the marina boasted views that made me dream of living here.

## Final Moments: Qatar’s Marina and a Shake Shack Send-Off

Before our flight home, we savoured our last few hours with burgers at Shake Shack. It was my first time trying the popular franchise, which turned out to be a perfect end to our whirlwind adventure.

Reflecting on our journey, both Bali and Qatar left us with unforgettable memories—each with its own unique blend of culture, relaxation, and excitement. From jungle rainstorms in Bali to the desert charm of Doha, this trip had it all.
