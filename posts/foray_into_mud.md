There have been a few opportunities lately to be involved in space planning and Architectural drafting. It brings up feelings of nostalgia and reminiscence.

The project goal was to optimise a 12 square metre plot of land for an apartment block. The trick in this case was to create a floor plan that could potentially work for all floors of the building.

The plan proposed by the contractors didn’t have optimal usage of space. Placement of the amenities was scattered.

To make construction and facilities installation smoother, our proposal was to group kitchens and WC’s in the same area and to extend living space by removing unnecessary corridors.

The client was not too keen on an open plan kitchen area because of the possible living arrangements of the apartment, with different families possibly living under the same roof, maintaining privacy was essential.

There’s nothing quite like seeing a drawing come to life. Going from an empty plot of land to mud, stone, and finally a building.
