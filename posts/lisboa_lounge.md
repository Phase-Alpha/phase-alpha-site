# Lounging Around

I’ve had the American Express (AMEX) Gold Card for quite a few years now. The perk that I’ve always wanted to use was the lounge club, to have access to a lounge on a long layover. A buffet of food and drink, entertainment, shower rooms and sleeping pods, what’s not to like about lounges?

Sadly I have only had the chance to use this particular feature of the card a couple of times. Once pre-COVID, and a second time just recently. If you are planning a journey far away, in excess of 8 hours in the air and with transfers to boot, I recommend adding a 3 hour layover for your transit. With a gold card you can take advantage of a quiet space to refresh yourself and fuel up.

On our way to Portugal and Spain I managed to take advantage and use the lounge, little did I know that although the buffets were closed, there was a till to order as much food as you wanted. If only we didn’t eat prior to going in to the lounge.

Even if you’re full, there’s always room for Pastel de Nata!

Apply for the gold card below!
Get bonus miles! Ok, I also get miles, so it’s win win!!
And to sweeten the deal, AMEX has upgraded the lounge club to the ‘Priority Pass’, and even though both schemes are owned by the same parent company, the Priority Pass gives you access to all of the same lounges that the Premium Platinum card would.
